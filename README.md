# Introduction

This repository contains the source code for a physics engine I am developing, which is going to be submitted as my A-Level EPQ artefact.

The physics engine attempts to simulate basic mechanics, including: forces; force integration; collision detection and resolution; friction; and so forth.
My language of choice for this project is Rust, and graphics library used is SDL2, by means of the [sdl2-rs](https://docs.rs/sdl2/latest/sdl2/#) crate.
